  details: `Patteserie Bakery & Cakes blossomed in early 2025 from a simple philosophy:
    that gourmet indulgence should be undeniably joyful and picture-perfect. We blend 
    the meticulous craft of classic French p√¢tisserie with a whimsical, modern heart, 
    creating artisan cakes, comforting bread, and flaky pastries as delicious as they 
    are delightfully cute.`,
